## About bitcoin2network project

**bitcoin2network** is an effort to create a privacy-centric, multi-tier, blockchain based ecosystem that is self-regulating and adaptive.

The mission of bitcoin2Network is to develop and promote its entire ecosystem without ever needing to collect a single penny from the community. The founding team of this project believes that the true intrinsic value of any open source project is derived from the time, efforts, and skills contributed by its community members. In fact, any open source project that collects millions of dollars from people nullifies the core concept of being open source– An open source project must always be developed by its community via non-monetary contributions.

Therefore, an Innovative Strategy to aide **bitcoin2network** project development is put in place- that strategy is NOT to collect an absurd amount of money from people for the development and implementation of the proposed blockchain solutions, but rather to offer a billion coins to the community via Community Building Events. These Community Building Events (CBEs) are bounty reward campaigns held to distribute B2N coins to community members for their non-monetary contributions to help develop and promote the project. That is why 5% of total supply of 21 billion B2N coins are set aside to be distributed through these bounties.

**bitcoin2netwrok** provides a fair opportunity for everyone to get involved and earn B2N coins, via bounties, in exchange for their time, efforts, and skills contributions.

**bitcoin2network** protocol is an enhancement over the original CryptoNote protocol. It is a privacy-centric, secure, untraceable, decentralised digital currency that enables users to process private instant payments from anywhere in the world. bitcoin2network uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. **bitcoin2network** is the name of an open source software which enables the use of this currency.

**bitcoin2network** will create Payment Gateways for integration into e-commerce systems and services retail websites to accept digital currency payments, thus giving digital currency a real world use case.

In addition, digital wallets for storage of cryptocurrencies will be made available on our exchange, as well as exclusive applications for Android, iOS, Linux and Windows platforms.

bitcoin2network is a brain-child ambitious project of a tech-savy team that possess the required skillset to make this project reality.

**BEWARE!** No ICO or any other public sales event of any nature will ever be held by bitcoin2network to raise money for the development of its proposed technology.
